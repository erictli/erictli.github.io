              <h3>Sears Holdings was focused on growing its rewards program to provide value across its customers' lives, wherever and whenever they shopped. I helped conduct research and interviews that identified that users cared most about points and coupons and struggled to understand the existing rewards program. I then built and lead a team to create new web and mobile experiences focused on simplifying the program and helping members save money.<br><br>I directly contributed to the design and ideation of a new mobile-application aimed at helping users save money by earning points and finding coupons wherever they shop. I did everything from designing and pitching concepts, to developing detailed UX flows and working with other designers to design mobile interfaces. In addition to contributing design, I lead a product team, managed partner and agency relationships, and helped conceive and execute labs experiments in local fulfillment and conversational commerce.<br><br><i>Note: Images below are work in progress.
