              <h3>Moneythink is a growing, award-winning non-profit that wants to make sure all students have access to a financial education. They started as an organization focused on in-person mentorship but recently began to focus on combining the power of mobile technology with mentorship to scale their impact.<br><br>I helped Moneythink design and develop a new website to better tell their story to donors and partners. After conducting research on user-criteria for non-profits and examining other non-profit experiences, we decided that our priority was to tell a story about our mission, visually show our impact, and highlight the unique mobile portion of our solution. The site that I designed and helped develop used rich imagery, videos, and direct quotes (we also experimented with audio) to show Moneythink to potential partners. We highlighted the mobile product and showcased press and personal impact, all while staying true to the Moneythink brand (which I helped design and develop back in 2012).<br><br>The new Moneythink site is coming soon. For now, you can learn more about Moneythink at <a target="blank" href="http://moneythink.org">Moneythink.org</a></h3>
