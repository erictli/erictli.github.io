              <h3>I started Topology with a friend in January 2015. Our goal was to create an apparel brand that combined high-quality construction with unique fabrics at a direct-to-consumer price point. We wanted our digital experience to be very straightforward to navigate on web and mobile and to put the emphasis on the product.<br><br>We chose Shopify as our e-commerce platform because it was very customizable, had a robust set of admin features, and offered a smooth checkout experience. We completely customized the front-end design to create a simple, elegant, and professional experience. Based on our research, we found that fit and fabric were most important to consumers so we highlighted those attributes in our messaging, photography, and design. This was my first project where I was responsible for both design and implementation of code and I was a bit constrained by my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS (but learned a ton).<br><br>In addition to designing and developing the UI, I was also responsible for fabric sourcing, production management, photography, and co-managed overall operations.
