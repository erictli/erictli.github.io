              <h3>Too often, scheduling meetings requires awkward email exchanges, tabbing back and forth between email and your calendar, and manually sending meeting invites. We're working on building Garner, a solution that lets users generate a sharable scheduling calendar that syncs automatically with their Google Calendar (with more integrations to come).<br><br>We believe Garner can make scheduling easier for a variety of users from UX designers conducting user interviews to recruiters setting up phone screens and small businesses booking appointments. Our design priorities are to create a product that looks professional on web and mobile and is very easy to set up and use for both the user and anyone that sees the calendar. We've focused on creating a calendar that is simple and beautiful out of the box while allowing users to represent their brand through customization. We also want to be able to help our users start saving time on their first use, and therefore are focused on creating an experience that is extremely easy to set-up, customize, and distribute.<br><br>I am focused on the product, design, and front-end development of Garner and we plan to launch in early 2016. We've chosen to limit the initial product to focus on the core task of creating and sharing a calendar but plan to include additional features like mass-emailing and automated appointment confirmation in future releases.
