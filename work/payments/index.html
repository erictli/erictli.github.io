          <p class="tldr">tl;dr: We revamped our loan repayment experience to be more user-friendly and operationally efficient. We did this by speaking with borrowers and testing prototypes.</p>
          <p>Bread partners with retailers to offer an easy and transparent way for shoppers to pay monthly for their large purchases. After customers make a purchase using Bread, we are responsible for making sure they are able to easily and reliably make monthly payments on their loans.</p>
          <p>Bread's loan repayment experience is a very important for both Bread and and our customers. Creating an effective user experience helps to ensure that Bread gets paid, our operations team isn't flooded with questions, and consumers are able to easily navigate the stressful event of giving away their hard-earned money.</p>
          <h2>Understanding a borrower's needs</h2>
          <p>Early on in my time at Bread, we identified that our loan repayment experience wasn't meeting customer needs. We sat just a few desks down from our operations team and were hearing from them that customers were accidentally making incorrect payments and calling our support line with questions. Many of these customers had intended to make extra principal payments to their loan but were accidentally pre-paying future installments instead. Based on my initial impressions of our payment product, I hypothesized that the user experience was to blame for many of these issues.</p>

          <p class="img-caption">A few screens showing how the payments experience looked when I joined Bread. There was quite a bit of design debt, including confusing UX and issues with responsive design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>In order to make sure we were solving the right problem, we first took the time to understand how and why our borrowers wanted to make different types of payments. We surveyed and interviews customers to understand their payment habits, what factors they considered when deciding how to pay, and the language they used to talk about different types of payments. From the survey we found that most borrowers either used autopay or paid the installment due each month. About 15% of customers paid the installment plus extra principal. Interestingly, nobody we surveyed wanted to pre-prepay multiple installments but a few did mention wanting to pay off their full loan early. We also spoke to 8 customers to better understand the context and motivations behind their actions. From our interviews, we learned that most users who didn't use autopay were looking to pay more than their installment amount, based on what they could afford each month. We also found that everyone we talked to said they wanted any extra payment to go to principal rather than future installments. Finally, we found that most users thought the existing payment experience was generally easy to use and our email communications were clear. </p>

          <p class="img-caption">We began by mapping out and aligning on a rough architecture diagram of all areas the customer touched during the payment journey.</p>

        <div class="text-container">
          <h2>Design exploration</h2>
          <p>In parallel with our research and categorizing the types of payments users wanted to make, we started exploring designs for our new member experience. We created a diagram of the payment flow to make sure we were thinking through all of the user touchpoints and edge cases. On the visual and interaction side, we started off by going very wide in our exploration - experimenting with different payment patterns, rethinking areas of our entire member portal, and experimenting with visual styles. Since more than half of our borrowers visited the portal on mobile devices, we prototyped in both mobile and desktop.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="img-caption">Explorations of different areas of our customer payment experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>From our research and stakeholder conversions, we took away some key areas that our designs needed to address: 1) Most customers were either paying their current installment or wanted to pay down their principal early (it isn't in the customer's interest to prepay future installments and everyone we spoke to understood that). 2) Customers were generally happy with our member portal and, other than needing to fix the user experience around making a payment, there weren't other urgent improvements we needed to make. 3) Autopay is frequently used and good for the business so we should promote it.</p>
          <p>So, we focused our efforts on improving the core payment experience. We streamlined our payment options based on what we had found in research. We also split the payment method and payment type screens into linear steps (we had seen in usability tests that people struggled to figure out where to click in our old experience). Finally, we made Autopay a more prominent call to action on our homepage.</p>

        <div class="text-container">
          <p>As we refined our designs, we reviewed our progress with our enginerering and operations teams to make sure we were addressing all of the edge cases. We also prototyped the new designs in Invision and Framer and ran usability tests to make sure we weren't creating confusing experiences (this led us to make some adjustments to our messaging and content).</p>

        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="../../images/payments-details.jpg">
          <p class="img-caption">As a result of our new payment options, we saw an increase in the number of users who were making payments to principal above their installment amount and a reduction in mistaken payments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
          <h2>Launching a minimally viable version</h2>
          <p>Given our bias towards getting to user impact quickly, I paired with an engineer on implementation and we prioritized implementing the most meaningful changes to the UX over changes to the visual style of our members portal. When we launched the new flow, we saw a reduction in payment mistakes and support calls about payments. Based on what we had heard from customers, we also introduced a new, more customer-friendly way for borrowers to make principal payments on top of what was due each month. We quickly saw this payment-type grow to account for a significant portion of all of our payments.</p>
