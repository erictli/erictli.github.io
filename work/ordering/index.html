        <h3>The opportunity</h3>
        <p>When ordering food delivery, we often need to compromise. Maybe you want sushi when your husband wants a salad or perhaps you want to add a coffee to your lunch. Most often, users end up compromising and ordering from just one spot.</p>
        <p class="mb-48">At the same time, Uber aims to grow order volume at positive economics. One of the ways that we can do this is by increasing basket size, and over the long term, driving increased engagement through new use cases.</p>
        <h3>Starting with an idea</h3>
        <p>The idea of multi-restaurant ordering had been floating around for a while. During a brainstorming session with product and engineering, we decided to start sketching out how we could make this happen. We had recently launched the ability to batch orders between restaurants (we dispatch a courier to pick up orders from separate restuarants in one trip). Could we viably extend this to allowing users to order from multiple restaurants?</p>

      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>I worked with our product, analytics, and engineering leads to scope, evaluate, and pitch the project. We estimated that we could maintain positive unit ecomomics for the feature while offering sufficient restaurant selection as well as a delivery discount. We also found that no major competitors were offering this feature and it was opportunity for Eats to differentiate itself. Interestingly, we also saw that a small but meaningful subset of users were already placing concurrent orders as separate deliveries.</p>

        <h3>Landing on an MVP</h3>
        <p>After getting buy in from leadership, I explored and proposed a variety of approaches to the MVP. We considered enabling multi-restaurant ordering for all restaurants, limiting the feature to a select number of restaurants through a homepage carousel, and a lower-lift version where users could add restaurants after they placed their initial order.</p>

          <p class="caption">Some of the initial concepts we explored.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p>In order to better understand multi-restaurant ordering use cases and decide on a path forward, I led a user research study. We spoke to users who had placed concurrent orders as well as those who had not. Overall, users were enthusiastic about multi-restaurant ordering and saw it as a way to 1) not compromise when eating with partners or friends and 2) to add on drinks, snacks, and desserts to individual orders. While users expressed interest in the post-order add-on approach, they preferred being able to plan for multi-restaurant orders before they ordered form the first restaurant.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="text-container">
        <p class="mb-48">Based on our findings and discussions with product leaderships, we decided to move forward with the carousel approach. The upsell approach limited the use cases we would be able address and launching the feature across all resturants introduced too much complexity and risk. The carousel approach, we felt, was the best way to evaluate interest in the value proposition and prove out our logistics and unit economics.</p>
        <h3>Executing on the consumer and courier experienes</h3>
        <p>Even with our MVP, our feature cut across several teams and product areas. We methodically explored and landed on designs for each area of the app and reviewed our proposals with product managers and designers from the platform, ordering, delivery experience, tipping and ratings, and courier teams. I also worked closely with our engineering leads throughout the process to uncover technical constraints and find compromises that maximized impact while minimizing effort. Some key areas that the project touched included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ordering experience.</strong> We leveraged existing components to create entrypoints for the homepage, restaurant pages, and cart. We also designed a new experience that allows users to switch between eligible restaurants. We also named the feature and created iconography and illustrations. Finally, we identified and solved for edge cases where our feature would collide with existing messaging and promotions.</li>
          <li><strong>Checkout experience.</strong> Our checkout team was working on a new checkout design in parallel. We worked with them to extend their single-restaurant cart and checkout for the multi-restaurant use case.</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery experience.</strong> This was an area where we decided to compromise from an ideal experience. Due to technical limitations, we decided early on that it wasn't worth the effort to build a combined delivery experience. Instead we made impactful copy changes and used messaging to explain to users how the delivery experience would work. We also addressed edge cases where we needed to send multipler couriers to delivery the order.</li>
          <li><strong>Tipping and cancellation.</strong> We defined new logic to handle about a dozen new tipping and cancellation scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>Courier experience.</strong> In addition to making basic changes to enable the dropoff of multiple orders at a single location, we introduced education and messaging to prevent courier mistakes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>We're currently building this feature and preparing for launch. We view our initial approach as a minimal test of the multi-restaurant ordering value proposition. We see opportunities to refine the exprerience post-launch, including improving the delivery tracking experience and refining the ordering flow based on what we learn from usage.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there is also a lot of long-term potential for multi-restuarant ordering. If we roll the feature out beyond our carousel entrypoint, we'll need to introduce additional features for browsing and discovery (e.g. filtering and categories, a universal restaurant page entrypoint). There is also room to expand the feature beyond food and allow for cross-ordering with other verticals like grocery, convenience, and alcohol.</p>
